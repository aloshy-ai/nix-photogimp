## Features

- Photoshop-like tool organization and interface
- Familiar keyboard shortcuts
- Pre-installed Python filters
- Custom splash screen
- Maximized canvas space
- Seamless integration with macOS
- Automatic configuration management
- Non-destructive installation (preserves original GIMP configuration)

## Prerequisites

- macOS (supports both Apple Silicon and Intel)
- Nix package manager with flakes enabled

## Installation

### Using nix-darwin

Add this flake to your `flake.nix`:

```nix
{
  inputs.nix-photogimp.url = "github:aloshy/nix-photogimp";
}
```

Then include it in your configuration:

```nix
{
  imports = [ 
    inputs.nix-photogimp.darwinModules.default
  ];
}
```

### Using home-manager

Add to your home-manager configuration:

```nix
{
  imports = [
    inputs.nix-photogimp.homeManagerModules.default
  ];
}
```

### Direct Installation

You can also install it directly using:

```bash
nix profile install github:aloshy/nix-photogimp
```

## Usage

After installation, you can find PhotoGIMP in your Applications folder as "PhotoGIMP.app". Launch it like any other macOS application.

The first time you run PhotoGIMP, it will automatically:
1. Back up your existing GIMP configuration (if any)
2. Set up the PhotoGIMP customizations
3. Restore your original configuration when you close GIMP

## Development

To build and test locally:

```bash
# Build the package
nix build

# Run tests
nix flake check
```

## Technical Details

The flake provides several outputs:

- `packages.photogimp`: The base PhotoGIMP package
- `packages.photoGimpApp`: The macOS application bundle
- `darwinModules.default`: NixOS Darwin module
- `homeManagerModules.default`: Home Manager module
